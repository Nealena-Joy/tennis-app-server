App:  TennisLab

Mission Statement

Tennis is an expensive sport. For players who really want to improve, they would have to hire a personal coach to train with regularly and to show up for matches.

This app is for tennis players who want to improve their game by having matches analyzed (point by point) by a coach and obtaining feedback to ultimately create a detailed plan on how the player could improve.
